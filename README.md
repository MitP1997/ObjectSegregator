# Object Segregator

A bot that would segregate the objects based on the colors

**Hardware Components**:
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- IR Sensor
- DC Motor
- Motor Driver L298N
- Servo Motors
- Electromagnet
- Relay 

**Uses**:
- *Arduino Uno*: Arduino is a microcontroller that is used to control the entire system based on the sensor outputs. 

- *Ultrasonic Sensor*: The objects were placed on a conveyor belt. The ultrasonic sensor helped to locate the position of the box on the conveyor belt.

- *IR Sensor*: The IR sensor was used to detect the color of the object.(black/white)

- *DC Motor*: The conveyor belt was operated with the help of DC Motors.

- *Motor Driver L298N*: The motor driver was used to control the speed of the conveyor belt and stop it when needed.

- *Servo Motors*: The servo motors were used for the movement of the arm of the bot.

- *Electromagnet*: Electromagnet was used to pick up the object from the conveyor belt and drop it in the box to segregate it.

- *Relay*: Relay switch was used to control the power to be supplied to the motor.
